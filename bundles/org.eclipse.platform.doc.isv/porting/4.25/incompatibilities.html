<title>Incompatibilities between Eclipse 4.24 and 4.25</title>
</head>

<h1>Incompatibilities between Eclipse 4.24 and 4.25</h1>

<p>
  Eclipse changed in incompatible ways between 4.24 and 4.25 in ways that affect
  plug-ins. The following entries describe the areas that changed and provide
  instructions for migrating 4.24 plug-ins to 4.25. Note that you only need to look
  here if you are experiencing problems running your 4.24 plug-in on 4.25.

<h2>1. <a name="icu4j-change">Different providers for 3rd party packages may result on unmatched requirements</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Clients that use <code>Import-Package</code> with a version requirement for some 3rd-party packages:
<ul>
<li>com.ibm.icu</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>
Upstream bundles as provided by the 3rd-party projects are not shipped by default by Platform instead of Orbit's one. Orbit usually add
a version on package exports; this version does not match what upstream projects define.
</p>
<p>
As a result, some Import-Package requirements that used to be satisfied using Orbit-provided bundles may now not be satisfied with upstream
bundles, preventing proper installation or execution.
</p>
<p><strong>Action required:</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Adjust Import-Pacakge directives in MANIFEST.MF for the affected packages, either by removing the version requirement or by fixing it according to new upstream provider (recommended), or</li>
	<li>Update your build script and other package definition to force inclusion of legacy Orbit-provided bundles</li>
</ol>
